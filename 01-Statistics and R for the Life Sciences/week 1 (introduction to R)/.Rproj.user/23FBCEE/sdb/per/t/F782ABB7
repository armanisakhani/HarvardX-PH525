For another explanation of dplyr see the dplyr package vignette: [Introduction to dplyr](http://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/dplyr/vignettes/introduction.html)\n\n### Why is it useful?\n\nThe package contains a set of functions (or \"verbs\") that perform common data manipulation operations such as filtering for rows, selecting specific columns, re-ordering rows, adding new columns and summarizing data. \n\nIn addition, dplyr contains a useful function to perform another common task which is the \"split-apply-combine\" concept.  We will discuss that in a little bit. \n\n### How does it compare to using base functions R?\n\nIf you are familiar with R, you are probably familiar with base R functions such as split(), subset(), apply(), sapply(), lapply(), tapply() and aggregate(). Compared to base functions in R, the functions in dplyr are easier to work with, are more consistent in the syntax and are targeted for data analysis around data frames instead of just vectors. \n\n### How do I get dplyr? \n\nTo install dplyr\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\ninstall.packages(\"dplyr\")\n```\n\nTo load dplyr\n\n```{r, message=FALSE}\nlibrary(dplyr)\n```\n\n# Data: mammals sleep\n\nThe msleep (mammals sleep) data set contains the sleeptimes and weights for a set of mammals and is available in the dagdata repository on github. This data set contains 83 rows and 11 variables.  \n\nDownload the msleep data set in CSV format from [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/msleep_ggplot2.csv), and then load into R:\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(downloader)\nurl <- \"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/genomicsclass/dagdata/master/inst/extdata/msleep_ggplot2.csv\"\nfilename <- \"msleep_ggplot2.csv\"\nif (!file.exists(filename)) download(url,filename)\nmsleep <- read.csv(\"msleep_ggplot2.csv\")\nhead(msleep)\n```\n\nThe columns (in order) correspond to the following: \n\ncolumn name | Description\n--- | ---\nname | common name\ngenus | taxonomic rank\nvore | carnivore, omnivore or herbivore?\norder | taxonomic rank\nconservation | the conservation status of the mammal\nsleep\\_total | total amount of sleep, in hours\nsleep\\_rem | rem sleep, in hours\nsleep\\_cycle | length of sleep cycle, in hours\nawake | amount of time spent awake, in hours\nbrainwt | brain weight in kilograms\nbodywt | body weight in kilograms\n\n\n# Important dplyr verbs to remember\n\ndplyr verbs | Description\n--- | ---\n`select()` | select columns \n`filter()` | filter rows\n`arrange()` | re-order or arrange rows\n`mutate()` | create new columns\n`summarise()` | summarise values\n`group_by()` | allows for group operations in the \"split-apply-combine\" concept\n\n\n# dplyr verbs in action\n\nThe two most basic functions are `select()` and `filter()` which selects columns and filters rows, respectively. \n\n### Selecting columns using `select()`\n\nSelect a set of columns: the name and the sleep\\_total columns. \n\n```{r}\nsleepData <- select(msleep, name, sleep_total)\nhead(sleepData)\n```\n\nTo select all the columns *except* a specific column, use the \"-\" (subtraction) operator (also known as negative indexing)\n\n```{r}\nhead(select(msleep, -name))\n```\n\nTo select a range of columns by name, use the \":\" (colon) operator\n\n```{r}\nhead(select(msleep, name:order))\n```\n\nTo select all columns that start with the character string \"sl\", use the function `starts_with()`\n\n```{r}\nhead(select(msleep, starts_with(\"sl\")))\n```\n\nSome additional options to select columns based on a specific criteria include\n\n1. `ends_with()` = Select columns that end with a character string\n2. `contains()` = Select columns that contain a character string\n3. `matches()` = Select columns that match a regular expression\n4. `one_of()` = Select columns names that are from a group of names\n\n\n\n### Selecting rows using `filter()`\n\nFilter the rows for mammals that sleep a total of more than 16 hours. \n\n```{r}\nfilter(msleep, sleep_total >= 16)\n```\n\nFilter the rows for mammals that sleep a total of more than 16 hours *and* have a body weight of greater than 1 kilogram.\n\n```{r}\nfilter(msleep, sleep_total >= 16, bodywt >= 1)\n```\n\nFilter the rows for mammals in the Perissodactyla and Primates taxonomic order\n\n```{r}\nfilter(msleep, order %in% c(\"Perissodactyla\", \"Primates\"))\n```\n\nYou can use the boolean operators (e.g. >, <, >=, <=, !=, %in%) to create the logical tests. \n\n# Pipe operator: %>%\n\nBefore we go any futher, let's introduce the pipe operator: %>%. dplyr imports this operator from another package (magrittr).  This operator allows you to pipe the output from one function to the input of another function. Instead of nesting functions (reading from the inside to the outside), the idea of of piping is to read the functions from left to right. \n\nHere's an example you have seen:\n\n```{r}\nhead(select(msleep, name, sleep_total))\n```\n\nNow in this case, we will pipe the msleep data frame to the function that will select two columns (name and sleep\\_total) and then pipe the new data frame to the function `head()` which will return the head of the new data frame. \n\n```{r}\nmsleep %>% \n    select(name, sleep_total) %>% \n    head\n```\n\nYou will soon see how useful the pipe operator is when we start to combine many functions.  \n\n# Back to dplyr verbs in action\n\nNow that you know about the pipe operator (%>%), we will use it throughout the rest of this tutorial. \n\n\n### Arrange or re-order rows using `arrange()`\n\nTo arrange (or re-order) rows by a particular column such as the taxonomic order, list the name of the column you want to arrange the rows by\n\n```{r}\nmsleep %>% arrange(order) %>% head\n```\n\nNow, we will select three columns from msleep, arrange the rows by the taxonomic order and then arrange the rows by sleep\\_total. Finally show the head of the final data frame\n\n```{r}\nmsleep %>% \n    select(name, order, sleep_total) %>%\n    arrange(order, sleep_total) %>% \n    head\n```\n\nSame as above, except here we filter the rows for mammals that sleep for 16 or more hours instead of showing the head of the final data frame\n\n```{r}\nmsleep %>% \n    select(name, order, sleep_total) %>%\n    arrange(order, sleep_total) %>% \n    filter(sleep_total >= 16)\n```\n\nSomething slightly more complicated: same as above, except arrange the rows in the sleep\\_total column in a descending order. For this, use the function `desc()`\n\n```{r}\nmsleep %>% \n    select(name, order, sleep_total) %>%\n    arrange(order, desc(sleep_total)) %>% \n    filter(sleep_total >= 16)\n```\n\n\n### Create new columns using `mutate()`\n\nThe `mutate()` function will add new columns to the data frame. Create a new column called rem_proportion which is the ratio of rem sleep to total amount of sleep. \n\n\n```{r}\nmsleep %>% \n    mutate(rem_proportion = sleep_rem / sleep_total) %>%\n    head\n```\n\nYou can many new columns using mutate (separated by commas). Here we add a second column called bodywt_grams which is the bodywt column in grams. \n\n```{r}\nmsleep %>% \n    mutate(rem_proportion = sleep_rem / sleep_total, \n           bodywt_grams = bodywt * 1000) %>%\n    head\n```\n\n### Create summaries of the data frame using `summarise()`\n\nThe `summarise()` function will create summary statistics for a given column in the data frame such as finding the mean. For example, to compute the average number of hours of sleep, apply the `mean()` function to the column sleep\\_total and call the summary value avg\\_sleep. \n\n```{r}\nmsleep %>% \n    summarise(avg_sleep = mean(sleep_total))\n```\n\nThere are many other summary statistics you could consider such `sd()`, `min()`, `max()`, `median()`, `sum()`, `n()` (returns the length of vector), `first()` (returns first value in vector), `last()` (returns last value in vector) and `n_distinct()` (number of distinct values in vector). \n\n```{r}\nmsleep %>% \n    summarise(avg_sleep = mean(sleep_total), \n              min_sleep = min(sleep_total),\n              max_sleep = max(sleep_total),\n              total = n())\n```\n\n    \n### Group operations using `group_by()`\n\nThe `group_by()` verb is an important function in dplyr. As we mentioned before it's related to concept of \"split-apply-combine\". We literally want to split the data frame by some variable (e.g. taxonomic order), apply a function to the individual data frames and then combine the output.   \n\nLet's do that: split the msleep data frame by the taxonomic order, then ask for the same summary statistics as above. We expect a set of summary statistics for each taxonomic order. \n\n```{r}\nmsleep %>% \n    group_by(order) %>%\n    summarise(avg_sleep = mean(sleep_total), \n              min_sleep = min(sleep_total), \n              max_sleep = max(sleep_total),\n              total = n())\n```\n\n",
